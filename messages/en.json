      { "q": "What is GomiCale?", "a": "GomiCale is a free web service that automatically reads PDF garbage collection calendars and school/community schedule PDFs distributed by municipalities, then bulk-registers them to Google Calendar. Tasks that used to take hours of manual entry are completed in just 1 minute." },
      { "q": "Is it free to use?", "a": "Currently, GomiCale is completely free. Just sign in with your Google account to use all features. We may introduce some premium features in the future, but basic features will remain free." },
      { "q": "What types of PDFs are supported?", "a": "Primarily garbage collection calendar PDFs distributed by municipalities. Also supports school annual event schedules, community bulletin calendars, condominium management association schedules, and any PDF with dates and events. Both scanned image PDFs and text-based PDFs can be processed. However, extremely complex layouts or unclear text may reduce accuracy." },
      { "q": "Which Google Calendar will events be registered to?", "a": "Events are registered to the default calendar of your signed-in Google account (usually the calendar named after your email address). After registration, events can be edited, deleted, or moved just like regular Google Calendar events." },
      { "q": "Is there a limit to how many events can be registered?", "a": "There is no limit to the number of events that can be registered in a single PDF upload. You can register a full year's garbage collection schedule at once. However, PDFs with very many pages or complex layouts may take a few minutes to process." },
      { "q": "What if the PDF content is not read correctly?", "a": "AI analysis results can be edited directly in Google Calendar. Accuracy depends on the quality and layout of the PDF. Low scan resolution or complex table structures may reduce accuracy. If you encounter issues, please contact us via the support page." },
      { "q": "How is my uploaded PDF managed?", "a": "Uploaded PDFs are temporarily stored on the server for AI analysis processing. They are automatically deleted after analysis is complete. PDF content is never shared with third parties or used for marketing purposes. Please see our Privacy Policy for details." },
      { "q": "I'm worried about Google Calendar access permissions.", "a": "GomiCale uses Google's official OAuth authentication and only requests the minimum permissions needed to add events to Google Calendar. We never obtain your password, and you can revoke access at any time from your Google Account settings under Security > Third-party apps and services." },
      { "q": "Will events duplicate with existing Google Calendar events?", "a": "GomiCale adds events extracted from the PDF as new entries to Google Calendar. We perform duplicate checking and skip events with the same date, time, and title that already exist. You can check the number of skipped events in the registration history on the dashboard." },
      { "q": "Can I use it from my smartphone?", "a": "Yes, it works in mobile browsers including Safari on iPhone and Chrome on Android. PDF files can be selected from your phone's Photos app or Files app to upload." },
      { "q": "Are there any unsupported municipalities?", "a": "GomiCale is not limited to specific municipalities and supports any PDF calendar format from any municipality in Japan. However, accuracy may vary depending on how each municipality formats and distributes their PDF calendars." },
      { "q": "Can I delete my account?", "a": "Yes, you can request account and data deletion by contacting us. Deletion will remove your registration history and Google account integration information. Note that events already registered to Google Calendar will not be deleted — please remove those from Google Calendar if needed." }
